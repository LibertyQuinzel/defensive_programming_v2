# Topics (per-topic organization)

This folder contains per-topic copies of assignments, starters, skeletons, examples, and tests to make it easier to work on one assignment at a time.

Structure created:
- topics/00-intro/
- topics/01-guard-clauses/
- topics/02-sentinels/
- topics/03-design-by-contract/
- topics/04-decorators/

Notes:
- These are copies of the original files; the originals under `assignments/`, `starter/`, `skeletons/`, `examples/`, and `tests/` are unchanged.
- If you prefer actual moves (removing the originals), tell me and I can move the files instead.
- After reorganizing, run tests from repo root with `PYTHONPATH=. pytest -q` as usual.
