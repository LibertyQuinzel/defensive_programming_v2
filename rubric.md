# Rubric â€” Defensive Programming Mini-course

Use this rubric when grading student submissions. Each assignment is worth 10 points.

Criteria (per assignment)
- Requirements implemented (4 pts)
- Tests added and passing (3 pts)
- Code quality and readability (1 pt)
- Defensive patterns used correctly (guard clauses, custom exceptions) (1 pt)
- No bare `except:` or leaking sensitive data in logs (1 pt)

Guidance: encourage small, test-driven changes. Full credit requires passing CI and clearly documented changes in the PR.
